Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.</br></br>  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from</br>a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object</br>code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated</br>material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure</br>layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates</br>(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:</br></br>   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the</br>   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are</br>   covered by this License.</br></br>   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license</br>   document.</br></br>  4. Combined Works.</br></br>  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,</br>taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the</br>portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse</br>engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of</br>the following:</br></br>   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that</br>   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are</br>   covered by this License.</br></br>   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license</br>   document.</br></br>   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during</br>   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among</br>   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the</br>   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.</br></br>   d) Do one of the following:</br></br>       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this</br>       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form</br>       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to</br>       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of</br>       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the</br>       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying</br>       Corresponding Source.</br></br>       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the</br>       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time</br>       a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer</br>       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version</br>       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked</br>       Version.</br></br>   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise</br>   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the</br>   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is</br>   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the</br>   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the</br>   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If</br>   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany</br>   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application</br>   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation</br>   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL</br>   for conveying Corresponding Source.)</br></br>  5. Combined Libraries.</br></br>  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the</br>Library side by side in a single library together with other library</br>facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this</br>License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your</br>choice, if you do both of the following:</br></br>   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based</br>   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,</br>   conveyed under the terms of this License.</br></br>   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it</br>   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the</br>   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.</br></br>  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.</br></br>  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions</br>of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new</br>versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may</br>differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.</br></br>  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the</br>Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version</br>of the GNU Lesser General Public License "or any later version"</br>applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and</br>conditions either of that published version or of any later version</br>published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you</br>received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser</br>General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser</br>General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.</br></br>  If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide</br>whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall</br>apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is</br>permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the</br>Library.</br></br>

Effective Date</br></br>The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution</br>become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first</br>distributes such Contribution.</br></br>2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope</br></br>The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under</br>this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the</br>distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.</br>Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a</br>Contributor:</br></br>(a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;</br>    or</br></br>(b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's</br>    modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its</br>    Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor</br>    Version); or</br></br>(c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of</br>    its Contributions.</br></br>This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,</br>or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with</br>the notice requirements in Section 3.4).</br></br>2.4. Subsequent Licenses</br></br>No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to</br>distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this</br>License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if</br>permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).</br></br>2.5. Representation</br></br>Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its</br>Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights</br>to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.</br></br>2.6. Fair Use</br></br>This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under</br>applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other</br>equivalents.</br></br>2.7. Conditions</br></br>Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted</br>in Section 2.1.</br></br>3. Responsibilities</br>-------------------</br></br>3.1. Distribution of Source Form</br></br>All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any</br>Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under</br>the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source</br>Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this</br>License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not</br>attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code</br>Form.</br></br>3.2. Distribution of Executable Form</br></br>If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:</br></br>(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code</br>    Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of</br>    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code</br>    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more</br>    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and</br></br>(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this</br>    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the</br>    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter</br>    the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.</br></br>3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work</br></br>You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,</br>provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for</br>the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered</br>Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the</br>Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this</br>License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software</br>under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of</br>the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered</br>Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary</br>License(s).</br></br>3.4. Notices</br></br>You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices</br>(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,</br>or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of</br>the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to</br>the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.</br></br>3.5. Application of Additional Terms</br></br>You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,</br>indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered</br>Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on</br>behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any</br>such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by</br>You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any</br>liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,</br>indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional</br>disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any</br>jurisdiction.</br></br>4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation</br>---------------------------------------------------</br></br>If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this</br>License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to</br>statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with</br>the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)</br>describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must</br>be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered</br>Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute</br>or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a</br>recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.</br></br>5. Termination</br>--------------</br></br>5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically</br>if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become</br>compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular</br>Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such</br>Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an</br>ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the</br>non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have</br>come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular</br>Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor</br>notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the</br>first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License</br>from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after</br>Your receipt of the notice.</br></br>5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent</br>infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,</br>counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version</br>directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to</br>You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section</br>2.1 of this License shall terminate.</br></br>5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all</br>end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which</br>have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License</br>prior to termination shall survive termination.</br></br>************************************************************************</br>*                                                                      *</br>*  6.

This   *</br>*  limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or   *</br>*  personal injury resulting from such party's negligence to the       *</br>*  extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some               *</br>*  jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of           *</br>*  incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and          *</br>*  limitation may not apply to You.                                    *</br>*                                                                      *</br>************************************************************************</br></br>8. Litigation</br>-------------</br></br>Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the</br>courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal</br>place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that</br>jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions.</br>Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring</br>cross-claims or counter-claims.</br></br>9. Miscellaneous</br>----------------</br></br>This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject</br>matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be</br>unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent</br>necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides</br>that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter</br>shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.</br></br>10. Versions of the License</br>---------------------------</br></br>10.1. New Versions</br></br>Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section</br>10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or</br>publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a</br>distinguishing version number.</br></br>10.2. Effect of New Versions</br></br>You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version</br>of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software,</br>or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license</br>steward.</br></br>10.3. Modified Versions</br></br>If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to</br>create a new license for such software, you may create and use a</br>modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove</br>any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that</br>such modified license differs from this License).</br></br>10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary</br>Licenses</br></br>If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With</br>Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the</br>notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.</br></br>Exhibit A - Source Code Form License Notice</br>-------------------------------------------</br></br>  This Source Code Form is subject to the terms of the Mozilla Public</br>  License, v. 2.0.
